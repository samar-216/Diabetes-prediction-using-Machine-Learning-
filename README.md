# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based web app that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on several health parameters using a trained model.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

The target variable is `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).

## 🧠 Model Used

A machine learning classifier (like **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, or others) is trained on the dataset after scaling and preprocessing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualization)
- Streamlit (for web deployment)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes_Prediction.git
   cd Diabetes_Prediction
